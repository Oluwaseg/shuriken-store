## Setting Up Vite with React Helmet Async

If you're using `react-helmet-async` in your Vite-powered React application, you might need to configure Vite to properly handle this dependency. Here’s how you can do it:
 
### Installation

First, make sure you have `react-helmet-async` installed:

```bash
npm install react-helmet-async
```

### Configuring Vite

To ensure `react-helmet-async` is properly pre-bundled by Vite, you need to add it to the `optimizeDeps.include` array in your Vite configuration file.

1. **Open your `vite.config.js`** file (or create it if it doesn’t exist).

2. **Add `react-helmet-async` to `optimizeDeps.include`**:

   ```js
   // vite.config.js
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     optimizeDeps: {
       include: ["react-helmet-async"],
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Restart your development server** to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Using React Helmet Async

Import and use `react-helmet-async` in your React components:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Helmet, HelmetProvider } from "react-helmet-async";

const App = () => (
  <HelmetProvider>
    <div>
      <Helmet>
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Your page description" />
      </Helmet>
      {/* Your app components */}
    </div>
  </HelmetProvider>
);

export default App;
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Ensure Dependencies are Up to Date**: Make sure you have the latest version of `react-helmet-async` and Vite.

- **Clear Cache**: If you encounter issues, try clearing Vite's cache or deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies.

- **Check for Vite Config Issues**: Ensure there are no other configuration issues in your `vite.config.js`.

For more information, refer to the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React Helmet Async Documentation](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async).
